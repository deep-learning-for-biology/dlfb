# dlfb

This repo contains the **`dlfb` companion library**, with utilities to simplify preprocessing, model building, training, and evaluation.

The library is installed as one of the setup steps in the Colab notebooks available in https://github.com/deep-learning-for-biology/notebooks.

## Contributing

We welcome contributions!

- **Issues:** Use Issues only for reproducible bugs in the codebase (e.g. broken code, dependency errors, incorrect results). This separation helps keep bug reports from getting lost in general conversation.
- **Pull Requests:** Contributions that add new utilities, improve existing implementations, or expand the notebooks are very welcome! Please keep PRs focused and include a clear description of the change.

## Citations

If you use `dlfb` in your work and would like to cite it, you can cite the book like this:
